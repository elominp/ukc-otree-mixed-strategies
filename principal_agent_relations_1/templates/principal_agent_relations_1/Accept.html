    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <p>
        You will take part in a labour market. At the beginning of the game you will be randomly allocated the role of
        either worker or employer. Workers and employers will then be randomly matched together - one worker to one
        employer. Note that workers and emplyers will be re-matched at the start of each new game. You shall play
        several times each of the following three games.
    </p>
